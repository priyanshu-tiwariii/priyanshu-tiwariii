## About

I work across both frontend and backend development, with experience in building web applications, APIs, and distributed services. My work involves creating interfaces using React and Next.js, and developing backend systems with TypeScript, Node.js, Hono, PostgreSQL. I focus on building applications that are structured, clear, and easy to maintain.

I have worked with databases, containers, and service-level components, which has helped me understand how systems operate in real environments. I also explore topics such as replication, data flow, real-time communication, and backend design patterns.

I led a team at the Smart India Hackathon where we built a logistics platform involving routing, map integration, and data modeling. The project was selected as the winning solution and gave me practical exposure to engineering a complete system from planning to delivery.

I am pursuing a B.Tech in Information Technology at Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College, and I continue learning through personal projects and exploration of backend engineering, frontend architecture, and system behavior.
